📚 THEORY
LEDs and LASER diodes are commonly used sources in optical communication systems for both digital and analog transmission.
A linear electrical-to-optical converter is essential for intensity modulation and high-quality analog transmission.
LEDs exhibit a linear optical output with respect to forward current within a specific operating range.
🧪 PROCEDURE
Connect the power supply to the board.
Ensure all switched faults are in the ‘Off’ position.
Set emitter 1 block to Digital Mode.
Make the following connections:
Connect the bias 1 preset on comparator 1 (TP13) to emitter 1 input (TP5).
Turn the bias 1 preset fully counterclockwise. In subdued lighting, slowly increase the setting until LED light is just visible.
Connect the DMM between +12V supply and TP6 (LED cathode) to measure forward voltage (Vf).
Measure the voltage drop across the 1KΩ resistor (R9) by connecting DMM between TP6 and TP38.
Forward current (If) = DMM reading / 1000 (in mA)
Vary the bias 1 preset to adjust forward voltage (e.g., 1.3V, 1.4V, … 1.7V) and note corresponding forward current (If).
Record values of Vf and If, and plot the characteristic curve between them.
